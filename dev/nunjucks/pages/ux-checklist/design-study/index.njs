  <p>Once you have all the materials lined up, you need to move into figuring out what you’re actually testing. There are several methodologies to choose from, but the most commonly used is what’s known as the Think Aloud method. Equally as important is figuring out which features to test, and developing tasks to isolate those features. Trying to keep these as clear, concise, and small as possible (e.g. if you want to test your sign up flow, give users specific credentials to sign in with and leave 3rd party signup flows (Facebook, Google, etc.) for another task).</p>

  <p>One of the biggest mistakes I see teams make is leaving out the hypothesis. A test isn’t a test without a hypothesis. Generate your hypotheses after you define the tasks (so you don’t introduce bias), and be specific (e.g. 80% of users will complete this task within 30 seconds). Defining acceptance criteria helps provide hard, objective numbers to an otherwise soft, subjective practice. You'll thank yourself later when you're preparing the report.</p>

  <p>Don’t forget about incentives for participants, either. It’d be nice to think people will do this out of the good of their hearts, but more likely than not you’ll need to compensate them somehow. One of the best tools in your arsenal to combat dropoff rates is how you incentivize participants. The more of an incentive, the less likely you are to have users drop out of the process or no-show, though there's a point of diminishing returns. If you're paying too much (or using something like free membership to your service), you're going to attract users for the wrong reasons: notably, their sole interest will be in what you're giving.</p>

  <p>How much you should pay varies on how long/complex testing sessions are and how specialized your target user is. Nielsen Norman Group has a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recruiting-test-participants-for-usability-studies/">really good overview</a>, though you can probably get by on the rule-of-thumb of $1 per minute of test time. You're much better off overpaying than dealing with the headache of no-shows.</p>
