  <h5 class="mb-5">How to reflect on your work and prepare it for presentation.</h3>

  <p>If you have hopes of ever doing this again, you’ll need to find a way to make your findings (and recommendations) presentable and actionable. Usability research for its own sake is a wonderful thing, but more likely than not there are stakeholders who allocated funds for this and they’ll want some sort of return. That return comes in the analysis and presentation of what you found.</p>

  <p>The most immediate value is obviously to the product team responsible for what was tested. Work closely with them to walk through what was found and what can be done about it, and if possible, sit with them and help prioritize their next steps. There’s also value in reporting findings to higher-up stakeholders, as they’ll want to see the summary of what was found and what’s being done about it.</p>

  <p>A fringe benefit to doing research like this is the opportunity to publicize your findings. If you’re studying something that can be generalized, doing so in a whitepaper or a blog post can help the community and start to make a name for the brand as one that cares about users. If nothing else, letting your current users/customers know that you’re working to make the product better should earn some brownie points.</p>
