  <!--<p>Decide where you want to recruit from and how, and figure out how many to recruit (probably 1.5-2x your target). Incentives matter, too.</p> -->

  <p>This might be 4th on the list, but you should really start this as soon as possible. Once you’ve laid out who you’ll be testing you should start working on a recruitment strategy, including a participant screener. Put the screener out there as many places as you can - local forums/subreddits, Craigslist, meetups/user groups, etc. You’re going to need many more people to fill out the screener than you’ll need participants — you’ll lose probably about half at each step (screening, scheduling, showing up).</p>

  <p>Once you have the screener set up and in place, you need to figure out how participants will sign up for a timeslot. <a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a> is excellent for this, as is <a href="http://doodle.com/">Doodle</a> (though it requires a little more finagling). You’ll also need to set up reminders for participants, and provide them any instructions (e.g. directions to the testing facility).</p>
